  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "High ATK",
    "Can use the Typewriter, a crossbow turret with an independent redeployment time (that starts from when it is deployed) through Automatic Typewriter as a force multiplier, or as an invincible attacker that can be deployed deep in enemy lines",
    "Iamb provides a consistent increase to DPS",
    "Précis is effective to provide burst DPS and shortens the Typewriter's redeployment time",
    "Opprobrium gives a massive damage buff on top of reducing attack interval, and annihilates enemies in both Pozëmka and the Typewriter's range",
    "Stenography of Weaknesses gives the Typewriter's attacks a DEF reduction effect that is increased if it is adjacent to Pozëmka herself"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "High DP cost that increases in each promotion",
    "Short attack range and quite high attack interval",
    "The Typewriter lasts for a finite period of time; careful timing is required for maximum damage",
    "Iamb has offensive SP recovery",
    "Précis doesn't quite do enough damage against moderately durable enemies"
