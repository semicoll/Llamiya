  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Has an extended attack range of 2 tiles ahead",
    "Attacks deal 120% (130% with X-Module) damage against enemies not blocked by Pallas",
    "Decent DP cost",
    "Good DEF",
    "Whip of Conviction has a good chance of stunning the target in each attack, in addition to extending Pallas' range",
    "Birth of a Hero applies Vigor to Minoan Operators",
    "Blessing of Heroism applies a stronger Vigor to the friendly melee unit in front of Pallas, in addition to buffing their DEF and increasing their block count; if there are no melee units in front of her, Blessing of Heroism will be applied on Pallas herself",
    "Goddess' Inspiration slightly restores HP for Pallas and the friendly unit in front of her on each attack"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Despite the extended range, Pallas cannot attack flying enemies",
    "Birth of a Hero is situational since Minoan Operators are few in number",
    "Blessing of Heroism's effects applied after a delay, which can be detrimental at times",
    "Goddess' Inspiration does not apply to Operators that cannot be healed directly like Juggernaut Defenders/Musha Guards"
