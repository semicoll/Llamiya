  "cons": [
    "Only available from Festival limited headhunting banners from Earthborn Metals; Nian will not be available from any other headhunting banners",
    "High DP cost",
    "Copper Seal stops Nian from attacking",
    "Iron Defense's block and DEF buff, and Status Resistance does not affect Nian herself, and the block increase can be detrimental for Ambusher Specialists since it allows melee enemies to attack them",
    "Clairvoyance's Shields can be easily wasted when facing multiple weak enemies or those with low attack interval, and against damage-over-time effects"
