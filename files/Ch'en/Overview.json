  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Each attack hits the target twice",
    "Good HP and DEF, and can block two enemies",
    "Chi Xiao - Unsheath is devastating especially against groups of enemies, and can be used immediately after deployment at Mastery 3",
    "Scolding periodically gives additional SP to Operators with offensive and defensive SP recovery",
    "Chi Xiao - Shadowless is excellent for crowd-control and against bosses",
    "Blade Art allows Ch'en to sometimes dodge physical attacks"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Relatively high DP cost that increases with every promotion",
    "All three skills have offensive SP recovery, making them slow to charge outside combat even with Scolding",
    "Despite landing two hits, each attack only adds 1 SP",
    "Chi Xiao - Unsheath is not as effective against enemies with balanced DEF and RES",
    "Despite Chi Xiao - Unsheath being immensely powerful and can be used immediately upon deployment at Mastery 3, Ch'en's standard redeployment time prevents her from truly replacing an Executor Specialist",
    "Requires significant investment to be effective due to being dependent in Mastery training, especially for Chi Xiao - Unsheath"
