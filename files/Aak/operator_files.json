  "Profile": "A medical personnel from Lee's Detective Agency recommended by Mr. Lee, Aak was a well-known underground doctor operating in the gray zones of Lungmen.After joining, he proved to be a tremendous wellspring of medical knowledge and theory with the clinical experience to back it up, though his style of practice is rather worrying.However, based upon Dr. Kal'tsit's comprehensive evaluation, he was recommended on a provisional basis to the medical equipment department and technological development team.",
  "Clinical_Analysis": "Imaging tests reveal clear, normal outlines of internal organs, and no abnormal shadows have been detected. Originium granules have not been detected in the circulatory system and there are no other signs of infection. At this time, this operator can be confirmed to be uninfected. [Cell-Originium Assimilation] 0%Operator Aak shows no signs of Oripathy infection. [Blood Originium-Crystal Density] 0.11u/LOperator Aak is incredibly healthy. I must say, despite everything else here on Rhodes Island, your methods for preventing Oripathy as well as the research that has been conducted are indeed worthy of study.—Aak",
  "Archive_File_1": "A specialist operator who always wears a hippie-like grin.Conducts himself with a rather poor, devil-may-care attitude that even spills over to his medical practice, sometimes cracking jokes about his patients' injuries during treatment.However, his medical techniques are indeed unrivaled in the entirety of Rhodes Island.Usually he'll stay in the small laboratory set aside just for him. The strange smells and unsettling cackling serve as good deterrents to keep people from getting too close.",
  "Archive_File_2": "Though Aak doesn't exactly get along well with other operators, there are three cases that particularly stand out.The first is Hung. While most people find the ill-natured Aak to be impossible to deal with, Hung is his natural nemesis. If a situation with Aak truly became unbearable, just report it to Hung, and the situation will soon be resolved. While it cannot be said that Aak fears Hung, Hung unabashedly treats Aak like a little brother; and Aak, despite his usual attitude, probably sees Hung as an older sibling as well.The second is Waai Fu. Though the righteous Waai Fu and the ill-natured Aak would seem totally incompatible, the two have unexpectedly developed a good relationship as members of the same detective agency. Waai Fu believes that Aak is a fundamentally good person, whereas Aak sees Waai Fu as old-fashioned but not impossible to get along with. By the way, if Aak is out looking for trouble, you should call Waai Fu instead of Hung. The ensuing scene is quite entertaining.The third is Warfarin. After learning that the true identity of \"Mr. Blood\" was none other than Warfarin, even Aak, who had spurned mainstream medicine, couldn't help but to engage Warfarin in academic discussions on a frequent basis. Admittedly, Warfarin, whose views towards medicine differ slightly from other medics perhaps as a result of her longevity, and Aak, who is a bit of a freak himself, make an unexpectedly good duo. But as a caveat, when these two find out that they share some common interest and tastes, strange laughing and cheering have become far more prevalent than ever before – either from Warfarin's or Aak's lab, now with two voices instead of one.",
  "Archive_File_3": "Despite the questionable nature of Aak's medical breakthroughs, the discoveries he's made have indeed been amazing.While his irresponsible attitude has a tendency to make relatively innocuous conditions worse, he is known to tackle rare diseases with his own unique, accurate solutions. Not to mention, he frequently researches and develops medication that seems incomprehensible to the average person, such as pills that make farts smell like watermelon, or make people lose the ability to recognize a certain color.Of course, if you knew who his father is, this tendency is no longer so puzzling.Aak's father used to be a well-known attending physician at the Lungmen Central Hospital and was renowned for his medical ethics. But due to a certain incident, he was framed by others for malpractice, after which his career plummeted and he disappeared from the public eye. The next time he reappeared, he had become a vicious illegal doctor in the underworld of Lungmen's black zone, with even Lungmen's gang bosses trembling at his feet. When this person perished a few years ago in a gang war, the entire Lungmen underworld breathed a collective sigh of relief.Aak clearly inherited his father's mantle, both the good and the bad. Even as a teenager, he made a reputation for himself in the underworld. Without discipline, he perhaps would have walked down the same path as his father, eventually becoming feared as well. However, after meeting Hung, he joined Lee's Detective Agency, a move that can be considered a turning point in his life.",
  "Archive_File_4": "Aak has already surpassed his father, who had fallen victim to being framed. Despite Aak's young age, his views towards medicine have already greatly surpassed that of even experienced doctors who have been immersed within the field for years.The reason behind this is simple: because he left the mainstream medical circles, he no longer views medicine solely from the perspective of a pure doctor.Pure doctors will think about problems within the scope of medical practice, preoccupied with how to better save people, often losing sleep or forgetting to eat in the process of developing new drugs. Most of Rhodes Island's medics fall under this category.However, Aak is different. He saw the limitation of medicine, and recognized that the existence of medicine was due to harm. Of course, a large proportion of this harm occurs naturally in the form of diseases, but because Aak grew up in the black zone, he saw more of the harm that people inflicted upon each other.Over time, he began to scoff at the idea of pure medicine, resenting his colleagues because they only knew how to save people. They would rush to the scene of a conflict, even the most advanced pharmaceuticals utterly powerless to stop the conflict from having broken out in the first place. The more lofty and prideful the medical profession, the more Aak came to hate it.Of course, Aak's thoughts are radical and fringe, with his daily behaviors reflecting a bit of his immaturity. Nevertheless, one cannot deny that his ideas are rooted in the bloody reality that shaped his upbringing, and events sometimes unfold in the way he describes. While Rhodes Island does pursue a lofty dream, it also never looks away from reality.After getting to really know him, several of Rhodes Island's core medic operators set aside their initial disgust towards him and, as his guardian Hung hoped for, decided to show him a better side of this world and provided him with the best possible conditions.After all, everyone knows that Aak is a genius, and over time, he will surely mature into a phenomenal doctor.",
  "Promotion_Record": "Aak's attitude when he received his second elite promotion – panic, is somewhat surprising. But if you think about it, it's not that hard to understand.He depreciated all medicine, and within that, saw himself as even lower – \"if medicine is useless, then is it not true that I, as a practitioner of medicine, is even more useless?\" The greater his medical proficiency, the more he rejects himself; but if he tries to leave medicine behind, he loses his sense of purpose, and thus the vicious cycle continues.No one told him that what he was doing was right, no one told him that it was fine to pursue that path, and nobody wanted to give him a place that would accept him. While it must be said that Lee's Detective Agency prevented his sense of morality from going too far astray, his psychological issue had not been resolved. Of course, this is not to place the blame upon the agency, for psychological problems usually require professional help even to be detected. Moreover, a personality like his also requires the proper environment.And at Rhodes Island, Aak is recognized and accepted for who he is. Everyone tells him that he is just, and reminds him that he is the best at what he does. As for the crux of the reason he resents medicine, Rhodes Island is already addressing the issue – we never intended to rely solely on pharmaceuticals to solve all the world's problems. He either will – or already has – found Rhodes Island to be a suitable place for him, and we will work hard as well to realize his ideals."
