  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Can deploy powerful summons as force multiplier",
    "Amidst Pleasant Melodies gives the summons a ranged Arts attack and can be used to deal heavy Arts damage to nearby enemies before recovering those with below 50% HP, replenishing the summon's deployment limit",
    "To Remain Oneself summons have an AoE attack and can be combined into even stronger \"higher\" ones",
    "Sips of Wine and To Remain Oneself gives Ling additional summons to use in each activation in addition to buffing her and the summons in various ways",
    "So is Writ, an Ode to Wine gives Ling additional SP and a stackable ATK buff when her summons are destroyed, recovered, or combined",
    "Very useful for low-op strategies, or can fill the gaps in certain squads."

  "cons": [
    "Only available from Festival limited headhunting banners; Ling will not be available from any other banners",
    "Rather low stats, even at maximum level",
    "The summons are counted towards the Unit Limit and only three of them can be deployed at a time",
    "Destroyed or retreated (except with Amidst Pleasant Melodies) summons do not replenish their deployment count",
    "To Remain Oneself summons cost a grand 23 DP to deploy and has a redeployment time of 20 seconds",
    "Higher To Remain Oneself summons use two Unit Limits instead of one",
    "Micromanagement-intensive, not recommended for casual or new players",
    "Must be leveled and promoted to Elite 2 for maximum effectiveness"
