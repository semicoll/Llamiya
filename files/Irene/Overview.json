  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Each attack hits the target twice",
    "Good HP and DEF, and can block two enemies",
    "All three skills Levitate enemies, which can be useful to separate dangerous enemies from the others",
    "Shattertides has a good range",
    "Flames of Castigation gives a 50:50 chance to ignore DEF when damaging enemies, which is guaranteed against enemies being Levitated by Irene's skills as they deals damage after Levitating the targets",
    "Judgment is a solid AoE skill",
    "Sword of Cleansing buffs ASPD, which is doubled when a Sea Monster is present"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Relatively high DP cost that increases with every promotion",
    "All three skills have offensive SP recovery, making them slow to charge outside combat",
    "Despite landing two hits, each attack only adds 1 SP",
    "Not as effective against enemies with high DEF as all three skills deal Physical damage, though this is alleviated by Flames of Castigation"
