  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Very high HP and ATK",
    "Wave Strike provides a massive ATK buff upon deployment for dueling bosses or strong enemies",
    "Abyssal Predator buffs the ATK (and max HP with the upgraded DRE-Y Module) of Abyssal Hunters Operators",
    "Tidal Elegy literally turns Skadi into an unstoppable juggernaut and has a good amount of initial SP",
    "Swift Action reduces redeployment time especially with the upgraded DRE-X Module"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Lower DEF than other Dreadnought Guards",
    "Can only block one enemy",
    "Tidal Elegy has a high SP cost, limiting its usage",
    "Even with Swift Action, Skadi's redeployment time is still slow (60 seconds, 56 seconds at Potential 3) without the upgraded DRE-X Module",
    "Has a straightforward function of dealing high physical DPS"
