  "name": "Goldenglow",
  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Attacks deal Arts damage",
    "Lower attack interval than other Casters",
    "Controls a Drone which attacks in tandem with Goldenglow, dealing more damage when attacking the same target continuously up to a certain limit",
    "All three skills give additional Drone(s) and have the Drones lock onto enemies even if they later moves outside Goldenglow's attack range until they are defeated or the skill expires",
    "Surging Current permanently extends Goldenglow's reach and requires less micromanagement",
    "Beacon's Wrath gives a chance for Goldenglow's Drones to self-destruct when attacking, dealing heavy Arts damage",
    "Crystalline Shine allow Goldenglow's Drones to acquire targets on the entire map and causes their attacks to temporarily slow the victims, making it excellent for stalling",
    "Precise Redirection makes Goldenglow and her Drones ignore some RES in each attack"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Very low ATK",
    "The Drone deals low damage initially and must continuously attack one target for maximum effectiveness",
    "The skills' Drone lock on can be difficult to utilize properly, particularly against numerous enemies, and will often prioritize those closest to the Protection Objective",
    "The Drones' self-destruction through Beacon's Wrath can deprive Goldenglow of some DPS potential",
    "Crystalline Shine stops Goldenglow from attacking and can be ineffective against enemies with Taunt or similar, as the Drones will focus on that enemy",
    "The Drones cannot attack enemies that are obscured by invisibility"
