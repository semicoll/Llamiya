  "pros": [
    "Great HP and ATK",
    "Attacks hit multiple enemies equal to block count",
    "Can block up to three enemies at Elite 2, like that of most Defenders",
    "Has excellent DPS with all three skills",
    "Chainsaw Extension Module extends attack range and allows Blaze to attack from behind another Operator or even through walls/ranged tiles",
    "Emergency Defibrillation heals Blaze by 50% of her maximum HP once at 25% or lower HP and keeps her HP from going below 50% for a short time, ensuring her survival",
    "Boiling Burst deals heavy damage to nearby enemies when it expires",
    "Harsh Training provides Status Resistance to Blaze once it is active"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "High DP cost that increases with every promotion",
    "Mediocre DEF when Chainsaw Extension Module and Boiling Burst are not factored in",
    "Emergency Defibrillation only works once per operation",
    "Boiling Burst causes Blaze to lose 25% of her maximum HP after it expires which can KO her (except when Emergency Defibrillation is active)"
