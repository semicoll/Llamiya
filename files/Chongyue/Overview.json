  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Very low attack interval",
    "Low DP cost relative to other Guards",
    "High ATK multipliers on skills let him break through high DEF",
    "Abundant is effective for massive burst damage",
    "Whisk can provide solid crowd-control due to its Levitate effect and area damage",
    "An End to War gives a chance that enemies hit by Chongyue's normal attacks take more damage from him",
    "Anatta is effective for locking down a lane or engaging multiple strong enemies from range if Chongyue is deployed correctly",
    "All Are Guests give SP when Chongyue defeat enemies with his skills"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Only available from Festival limited headhunting banners; Chongyue will not be available from any other banners",
    "Average-low HP and DEF, and can only block a single enemy",
    "Basic attacks do little to no damage against enemies with high DEF due to his relatively low base ATK",
    "Requires the use of skills to be in optimal effectiveness",
    "Whisk's Levitate is less efficient against enemies with high weight and is reliant on An End to War triggering to deal full damage",
    "Anatta can take some time to ramp up due to using Offensive Recovery and taking 5 activations to fully activate"
