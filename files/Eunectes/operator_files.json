  "Profile": "The leader of a certain tribe that resides in Acahualla—Gavial's hometown. She was admitted into Rhodes Island after passing the operator examination and began receiving treatment at the same time.Her physical qualities are no less impressive than Gavial's. Currently active in the battlefields with her trusted companion, the Raging Ironhide.",
  "Clinical_Analysis": "Imaging tests have shown the outlines of her internal organs to be indistinct due to abnormal shadows. Originium granules have been detected in her circulatory system, confirming her to be infected with Oripathy. [Cell-Originium Assimilation] 7%Small traces of infection are visible on the surface of the body. [Blood Originium-Crystal Density] 0.22u/LOperator Eunectes was infected at a relatively early age, and her condition is somewhat severe as it was never really kept in check. However, thanks to her excellent physical condition, the spread of the disease in her body has slowed down by a considerable degree, and it has further stabilized after receiving treatment. Further observation and regular treatment are required. Well, look what we have here! Your body's pretty well built!—Gavial",
  "Archive_File_1": "Eunectes is a Pythian girl whose interests can be described as somewhat peculiar.She isn't the type to actively raise conversations, nor is she the kind of person to keep quiet to herself. In many ways, her views and ideologies are much more normal compared to Gavial, who'd left home years ago, but she can be pretty stubborn when it comes to all matters machinery-related.When she first joined Rhodes Island, for a period of time, she opted to use her real name, \"Zumama\", as her codename just as Tomimi before her did. However, when Closure christened the newly rebuilt Big Ugly \"the Raging Ironhide\", she took the opportunity to give herself a new codename based on her tribe's name—\"Eunectes\".That being said, a sizable number of our operators, such as Gavial, still call her by her name.Based on her own personal account, she rarely ever picks fights with anyone, her frequent bouts with Gavial during their childhoods notwithstanding. As such, this will not be accounted for in her combat experience evaluation.",
  "Archive_File_2": "According to Eunectes's own personal account, her knowledge of anything not related to her tribe can be attributed entirely to her book collection.This explains how even though she was able to hit it off with Closure the moment she joined the Engineering Department—she also tore Closure's bag of chips from her hands and tossed it across the room out of rage just as quickly—her common sense and knowledge about our day-to-day lives are peculiar to say the least.Nonetheless, how she was able to pick up foreign languages and robotics just by flipping through a few books goes to show her learning ability is remarkable.It wasn't long before her learning ability led to an impressive development: after just a few months, Closure personally approved her request to be assigned to Engineering.Sadly, even though she was able to learn how to operate all sorts of machinery in no time, to this day she has shown no noticeable improvement when it comes to life outside her tribe.",
  "Archive_File_3": "After Eunectes joined Rhodes Island, she has become somewhat of a laughingstock thanks to her lack of understanding regarding anything she's unfamiliar with, and the funniest thing about her has to be her relationship with Lancet-2.The sight of Eunectes calling Lancet-2 her sister never fails to catch operators oblivious to this relationship by surprise. Of course, Lancet-2 is fairly popular amongst operators thanks to her personality, but Eunectes's passion for her is on another level.It isn't hard to fathom why, of course.Most of us have probably been so awestruck by something we've never so much as heard of that it sent chills down our spines at some point in our lives. The kind of moment that feels as though you flung open a whole new door, like discovering new untrodden lands. To Eunectes, that moment came as a child when she witnessed a nomadic city just passing through by chance. The gigantic machine, colored in its icy machinery colors, struck her with amazement like never before. That moment came again when she first heard Lancet-2 talk. This time, it was the possibilities that robotics has that struck her with amazement.Wouldn't most operators be just as surprised when they first come across operations platforms that talk? The difference here is that most operators aren't all that interested in robots and therefore don't react the same way Eunectes does.On the other hand, while Eunectes shows extraordinary respect to other operations platforms as well, Lancet-2 is particularly dear to her. This is actually a glimpse of her normalcy.Her special treatment for Lancet-2 can be described as ritualistic and as a sort of emotional sustenance. This is a beacon she picked for herself in her new life, and it can be even be seen as the manifestation of what she has always dreamt of achieving herself.Which is why, even though she's the developer of all the operations platforms and the person that Eunectes has come to look up to as her master, Closure has never tried to put a stop to her so-called \"stupid apprentice's\" behavior. She probably knows exactly how Eunectes feels.",
  "Archive_File_4": "Although the Doctor's trip to Acahualla had a happy, almost comedic ending, there is still a point worthy of discussion.Even though Eunectes's true goal has always been to build gigantic robots and nothing more, had this series of events not transpired, she would have become the Great Chieftain, and under her rule, the Acahuallan tribes would likely advance into a strange but nonetheless robotic era. By its very essence, it's an idea that runs against their traditions—a breakthrough.From this point of view, you could say Gavial was the manifestation of tradition itself. She believed in her own strength and didn't seek any outside help. Having abided by this principle for years, this has become one of the most exemplar examples of Acahuallan tradition.In other words, by its very essence, this series of events can be seen as a conflict between traditions and breakthroughs. If it wasn't for Gavial's relationship with Eunectes, if it wasn't for the region's lax sense of tradition to begin with, and if it wasn't for how modest the Acahuallan people were, history tells us all this would have ended very badly.Of course, that is simply conjecture, and this isn't to say that we were lucky things turned out the way they did. Rather, I wanted to pose an interesting question:If Gavial and Eunectes each represented a different lifestyle—Gavial's being the primitive yet free lifestyle while Eunectes represented a more orderly lifestyle that relied upon tools—would we be able to say for sure that one is more correct and would lead to a better life?To take this question one step further, what makes a good lifestyle?There isn't a single correct answer to this question, but if you look at how Gavial and Eunectes are such polar opposites yet alike in some ways, I believe this would be a interesting question to ponder over.",
  "Promotion_Record": "Regarding the partner of Eunectes, it is actually not the one that the Doctor and co. encountered in the rainforest. The name of that machine is \"Huge Ugly Thing\", nicknamed Big Ugly.However, due to the prototype of Big Ugly being too large, the aircraft could not fit all of it, and it was also destroyed at that time, so when returning to Rhodes Island, the aircraft did not carry many leftover parts of Big Ugly.The current one was completed with the joint efforts of the entire Engineering Department, and the second-generation machine was named by chief engineer Closure— \"Grumpy Ironhide\".On the surface, this machine is very similar to Big Ugly, but the inside of the machine is no longer ugly and messy; it contains the wisdom of the Rhodes Island Engineering Department.For Eunectes, this must be the most solid first step for her dream to become a reality.Additionally, after the completion of Grumpy Ironhide, the driver for Big Ugly that Eunectes occasionally mentioned, a creature named High Priest also began to appear frequently in Rhodes Island, and after learning about it, Dr Kal'tsit told operators not to care about it. Although this is somewhat of a concern, the High Priest's personality is joyful, and overtime, operators gradually got used to his existence."
