        "During Arknights' 2nd Anniversary event, a Bilibili uploader named 一只大哈鱼 drunkenly spent almost 3000 RMB (around $460 USD) in purchasing Originite Prime in order to pull for the Skalter/Kal'tsit banner. He recorded the video (thinking he was streaming), mumbling to himself things such as \"to sandwich Japan with our forces in order to save Skadi from nuclear waste!\" and \"We're too weak (to save her)!\" He even purchased plane tickets to Beijing and Nanjing.",
        "Towards the end of his recording, he purchased Eunectes' Forgemaster outfit, shouted, \"I love Eunectes (or 森RUA in Chinese) forever!\" and made her his Assistant.",
        "By the time he woke up sober the next morning, he uploaded an apology video. During the recording, he responded to Eunectes' Idle dialogue by telling her to shut up."
