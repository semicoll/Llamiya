  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Very high ATK â€“ the highest of all Defenders",
    "Very high HP",
    "Has an attack range of 1 tile ahead like most melee Operators",
    "Menacing Slash \"stunlocks\" the enemy being blocked by Eunectes, useful to duel strong enemies",
    "Peerless Bravery either increases damage dealt or applies the Sanctuary buff (reduces physical and Arts damage taken), depending on Eunectes' HP percentage",
    "Iron Will turns Eunectes into a literal war machine with excellent offensive and defensive capabilities",
    "Resilience increases SP generation rate"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Very high DP cost",
    "Can only block a single enemy, unlike other Defenders",
    "Can only generate SP while blocking an enemy (even with SP generators), making Menacing Slash and Iron Will cannot be charged outside combat",
    "Menacing Slash increases attack interval",
    "Iron Will stuns Eunectes for a short time when it expires where she can neither attack nor block enemies"
