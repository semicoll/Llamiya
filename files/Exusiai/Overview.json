  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Attack aerial enemies over ground ones",
    "All three skills have Exusiai attack in bursts of multiple hits",
    "Charging Mode has high sustained DPS",
    "Shooting Mode and (especially) Overloading Mode has extreme DPS against low-DEF enemies, and is amazing for taking out low-DEF, high-HP enemies",
    "Angel's Blessings affect both Exusiai and another random Operator, and can be useful if she is deployed early on"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Does almost negligible damage against enemies whose DEF is higher than Exusiai's ATK, even with all three skills (unless supported with buffers/debuffers)",
    "Overloading Mode's automatic activation can be detrimental in situations where precise timing is essential",
    "Angel's Blessings' random targetting can make it target undesirable operators"
