  "name": "Dorothy",
  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Classified as a ranged Operator with a ranged attack similar to that of Marksman Snipers (but does not prioritize flying units)",
    "Allows the deployment of Resonators, which are traps not counted towards the Unit Limit",
    "All three skills are automatically activated and gives Dorothy additional Resonators to use in each activation",
    "Dangerous Entity Removal reduce the victim's DEF, making them more vulnerable to Physical damage",
    "Quicksand Generation is good for stalling especially if the Resonator only hits one enemy",
    "High-speed Resonating Troubleshooter can cause massive Arts damage due to the \"chain reaction\" if deployed correctly",
    "Dreamer buffs ATK (up to a limit) every time a Resonator is triggered"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Not as effective as true Marksman Snipers in DPS",
    "The Resonators cannot be deployed on tiles occupied by enemies, will not be triggered by flying and invisible enemies, and will disappear when Dorothy is KO'd or retreated",
    "Despite being automatically given and have no deployment restrictions, there is a limit on how many Resonators Dorothy can hold at a time",
    "Micromanagement-intensive, not recommended for casual or new players"
