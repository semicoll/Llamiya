  "name": "Schwarz",
  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "High ATK",
    "Armor Penetration Arrow improves DPS and reduces the victim's DEF, making them vulnerable to more of Schwarz's attacks and physical Operators",
    "Final Tactics guarantee Armor Penetration Arrow's activation in each attack, allowing Schwarz to inflict massive DPS and quickly defeat bosses, and has a great uptime",
    "Crossfire buffs the ATK of Schwarz and all other Snipers present"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "High DP cost that increases in each promotion",
    "Short attack range and quite high attack interval",
    "Final Tactics increase Schwarz's attack interval and narrows her attack range to a frontal line, requiring proper placement for maximum effectiveness",
    "Not as versatile as other Snipers aside of Crossfire and Final Tactics, the latter of which must be upgraded to at least Mastery 1 for full effectiveness"
