  "Archive_File_1": "A taciturn Lupo youth.Though he declined to disclose his identity, the fact that he comes from Siracusa, coupled with his not-particularly-subtle attire, makes it fairly easy to guess what Vigil's background might be. As such, when he first visited Rhodes Island, a hushed silence followed wherever he went.But this situation was quickly dispelled before it could turn into trouble–During lunchtime, Chiave, a fellow Siracusan, greeted him cheerfully. Aosta and Broca, who were with him at the time, seemed reluctant to show their faces. However, the scenario that people were expecting to break out did not unfold, and Vigil had a calm and cordial conversation with Chiave's gang.This conversation ended with Chiave's arm around Vigil's shoulder, and Chiave proclaiming to the surrounding operators that his gang would celebrate Vigil's arrival.According to the recollection of an operator present at the time:\"Had people not already been familiar with Chiave's personality, they might've mistaken him for the one with the higher status back there.\"",
  "Archive_File_2": "Establishing ties with Nuova Volsinii was an unexpected opportunity for Rhodes Island, but also poses its own risks.The reason has nothing to do with Vigil; the city is simply too unique.The city is a special administrative region acknowledged by Signora Sicilia, where the mafias are not allowed to enter or peddle their influence. Of all the countries across this land, perhaps only in Siracusa can a city like this – independent of the existing powers – pop up out of thin air without causing widespread panic and backlash.The existence of this city undeniably represents a future recognized by Signoria Sicilia, a challenge to authority that may well unfold in Siracusa; however, it is also destined to stand in opposition to the other mafias.Vigil sought out Rhodes Island on the basis of medical needs.As a rule, Rhodes Island normally tries to avoid cooperating with such politically sensitive entities. However, when Operator Texas brought him and Penance before Dr. Kal'tsit's office, the situation became much more complicated.He made no effort to conceal the events that had unfolded in Old Volsinii. His vision of the future ultimately moved Rhodes Island, and so this relationship was realized.His reason for choosing to become an operator seems almost ordained by fate – what he said was, he saw how Rhodes Island gathered people from all across the land and all walks of life, and he wanted to spend more time communicating with and learning from them.He displayed a genuine thirst for knowledge of things beyond Siracusa, and his humility has won him the acknowledgement of most operators.As such, he has already made many friends, and they openly speak highly of him.It can even be said that Vigil's arrival changed many peoples' impressions of Siracusans.Consequently, this has also led him to stay at Rhodes Island for longer periods of time than his identity allows, which Penance frequently berates him for.",
  "Archive_File_3": "As long as Vigil and Penance are both on the landship at the same time, you will see them dining together.In order to avoid complicated rumors, after Penance joined Rhodes Island, Vigil would introduce her to the other operators as a big sister figure. While Penance has not really admitted to this point, she has also not gone out of her way to deny it.However, it is no mystery that both Penance and her ideals are special to him.\"I was brought up to be the famiglia's heir. From the very beginning, I've always been pursuing ways of expanding the famiglia's power, and ways of doing my job more efficiently. I'm not such a noble person.\" During a chat with the Doctor, when the topic of his origins came up, he smiled and explained: \"Now that I think about it, that was from before when Famiglia Texas was liquidated. As the power and influence of the Colombian[sic] famiglie grew, some of their ideals and practices started to leak over into Siracusa as well. For better or worse, Siracusa's famiglie also started to become more 'civilized,' and that affected me to some degree as well.\"\"Originally, I was going to become someone who would stop at nothing to secure advantages for the famiglia. But, Lavinia... Alright, I'll call her Penance here, since she seems to like that codename. Anyways, after my father brought her into the famiglia, things changed.\"After getting to this point, Vigil paused for a while, as if carefully considering his words. \"So many things happened along the way, including her dispute with my father. In the end, she decided to accept the position of judge that he arranged for her, but this isn't a story you should be hearing from me – ask her yourself if you're interested. Looking back, in the process of learning as much as I could to become an effective leader of the famiglia, I not only learned about Siracusa's rules and Columbia's cunning, but also of the justice she had never given up.\"\"Unfortunately, Demetri had always been tasked with the responsibility of intel gathering, so he was always running around and had little time to talk to Penance. If he had the same opportunities as me, maybe we wouldn't have turned out like this.\" He let out a sigh. \"Forget it, let's not talk about this anymore.\"\"In any case, Doctor, I see Penance as a superbly upstanding person. For her to be able to hold onto her ideals in a place like Siracusa is an incredibly rare and precious thing. Plus, my mother passed away at a young age, and my father... though we didn't have a bad relationship by any means, there were certain things that I could not easily share with him, so...\" He suddenly showed some hesitation and paused for a while when he got to this point, before finally continuing: \"When I was still relatively young, she played both an older sister role, as well as...\"\"Vigil, I need to talk to you about the planning of the new city. Also, I heard the quality of your work hasn't been up to par lately; have you been staying up late again?\" From not too far away came a clear, pristine female voice. Without a doubt, it belonged to Penance.\"Uhh... Doctor, if you'd excuse me.\" Vigil stood up and trotted towards the voice, mumbling justifications for himself as he ran: \"It's not like I held up the project or anything.\"In that rare moment, he appeared to be just another impetuous, fearless youth.",
  "Archive_File_4": "Vigil is full of uncertainties.He has never seen himself as having all the answers.As a matter of fact, had it not been for Rubio's death and Danbrown's accusations opening his eyes at a critical juncture, he most likely would've perished in the maelstrom that his father set into motion.When he stood in that church, he ultimately never asked his father why he did not spare him, why he would sacrifice the entire famiglia to do what he did. Because he already knew that the answer he'd receive would be no different from what he told Demetri.In the end, he cast aside his former brother and set out on a thorny path that had never before seen the light of day.Vigil is afraid.He does not know if he will be able to succeed.When he sat across from Signora Sicilia, he was already prepared to go out in a blaze of glory. After all, he never intended on answering to her. In the face of her casual yet also fateful question, he could only put his most heartfelt thoughts and ideas forward, and truthfully admitted to her that his ideas were far from bulletproof.After all, even if a new ideal had already sprouted within his heart, it was still immature.Vigil is anxious.He feels that there is too much for him to learn.While serving as Minister Carracci's secretary, he never had to deal with anything particularly complicated. But when confronted with official duties that would influence the operations of an entire city, he immediately came face-to-face with his shortcomings. This deficiency causes him a great deal of grief, as he is aware that the only thing that can fill this gap is time, which is the one thing he lacks.Despite that, all he can do is put his head down and do what needs to be done, nose to the grindstone. There is no other way.Regardless, Vigil knows that he is fortunate enough.Signora Sicilia accepted his challenge. He has Penance and Texas at his side to assist him. Furthermore, there are people in Nuova Volsinii who are also motivated to build a new city.He treads down a path that he cleaved opened for himself.He cannot assert that Siracusa will change as a result of his actions, but he knows that what he plans to do will leave an indelible mark upon the land of Siracusa.And he is ready to give everything.",
  "Promotion_Record": "Rhodes Island's cafeteria is committed to satisfying the different tastes of our diverse operators, often holding culinary experience weeks centered around the cuisine of specific countries, and Siracusans are one of the groups on Rhodes Island who assign the greatest importance to their own cuisine. Whenever Siracusan cuisine appears on the cafeteria's menu, Vigil will personally appear in the kitchen to ensure the dishes' authenticity. This is one of the few times when he reveals his cold, ruthless side, and may perhaps be the only conservative part of this young man who is otherwise committed to change and novelty.He will carefully examine each recipe in advance, urge Procurement to obtain raw ingredients from local, trustworthy Siracusan suppliers, and personally participate in the creation of each dish. Under such circumstances, even the most creative and liberated chefs are unwilling to leave their personal touches in these dishes, lest their intent to \"add tropical fruits to provide a wonderful taste and texture to the sauce\" earns them the premonition that \"someone is secretly staring at them from the darkness, warning that their lives are not securely in their hands.\"However, once Vigil leaves the landship, these same chefs will retaliate by making new renditions of Siracusan classics. For their safety, do not take pictures."
