  "pros": [
    "Very low attack interval",
    "Low DP cost relative to other Guards",
    "Left Hook hits two enemies within range",
    "Sweeping Stance is useful on the defensive due to HP regeneration, increased block count, and multi-targeting attack",
    "Forceful Fist temporarily reduces enemies' ATK",
    "Earth-Shattering Smash allows Mountain to attack adjacent enemies with stronger double-hitting attacks and push them back in each strike",
    "Sturdy Constitution buffs DEF and gives Physical dodge"

  "cons": [
    "Average-low HP and DEF, and can only block a single enemy (unless with Sweeping Stance)",
    "Does little to no damage against enemies with high DEF due to the relatively low ATK",
    "Sweeping Stance reduces attack range and DEF, making Mountain vulnerable to ranged enemies with high ATK",
