  "name": "Reed the Flame Shadow",
  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Attacks enemies rather than healing friendlies, dealing Arts damage",
    "Heals a friendly within range for 50% ATK when attacking enemies",
    "Wither and Thrive allows the Flame Shadow to provide effective support for melee units",
    "Cinder gives a chance to inflict the namesake debuff in each attack, reducing the target's ATK and applying Arts Fragility on them",
    "Ember of Life allows the Flame Shadow to cause mass destruction against clusters of enemies",
    "Reflected Shine heals the Flame Shadow whenever she heals a friendly unit",
    "Can be obtained and used even if the player does not have Reed in their roster"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Despite having a surprisingly decent DPS, the Flame Shadow is outperformed by dedicated Arts Operators when focused Arts damage is needed",
    "Without Ember of Life, Cinder is somewhat unreliable due to the subpar proc chance",
    "Ember of Life is graphically demanding especially if large swarms of enemies are present and may crash the game if the player's device is not strong enough to handle it!",
    "Cannot heal allies when there are no enemies in range, rendering the Flame Shadow useless when periodic instead of constant waves of enemies are present"
