      "text": "In her Japanese dialogue, there are tonal differences between her original self and her alter version, marked by a harsher tone. This actually alludes to Eyjafjalla's current medical condition in which her Oripathy is slowly corrupting her throat.",
      "sub_items": [
        "Coincidentally, her Japanese VA, Risa Taneda, once went on hiatus between 2016 to 2018 due to her throat issue. Unfortunately, she has to frequently go on several throat surgeries since then. The harsher voice is the side-effect of her throat treatment as a consequence. This can be interpreted as paying homage to both the character and the voice actor herself as well due to their shared circumstance."
