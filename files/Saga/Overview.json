    "Preaching Critically Wounds enemies that took lethal damage from Saga",
    "Cleansing Evil deals heavy Physical damage in a cross-shaped radius, can store multiple charges, and executes enemies Critically Wounded by it after resolving (the killing blow is attributed to Saga, allowing her to benefit from Preaching)",

    "Lower HP and DEF than other Pioneer Vanguards",
    "Preaching can be detrimental especially if Saga is deployed near a Protection Objective since she will not attack Critically Wounded enemies",

    "Fierce Glare increases attack interval"
