  "name": "Młynar",
  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Has a larger range than normal Guards with side tiles as well as frontal",
    "Relatively low DP cost",
    "Very high HP and can block two (three at Elite 2) enemies",
    "Gains ATK over time which starts after the skill is not active, up to twice of Młynar's base ATK over 40 seconds",
    "All three skills increase the damage dealt by Młynar's attacks",
    "Unresolved Sorrow will not reset the trait's ATK buff if Młynar defeats an enemy with it",
    "Wanderer improves DPS especially when three or more enemies are around Młynar, at which he also takes less damage",
    "Unbrilliant Glory removes everything from existence",
    "Unmoved counters any attacks directed at Kazimierz Operators with a weak Pure damage while Młynar is deployed"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Can only attack and block enemies while the skill is active, leaving Młynar combat ineffective otherwise (other than to be a sponge for ranged attacks)",
    "The ATK buff is removed when the skill expires upon being activated, except with Unresolved Sorrow after Młynar defeats an enemy",
    "Unresolved Sorrow increases attack interval",
    "The ATK buff decays at a rate of 10% per kill when Młynar defeats an enemy while Unbrilliant Glory is active",
    "Młynar Taunts enemies with Unmoved, which can be detrimental against enemies with ranged Arts attacks",
    "Must be used alongside Kazimierz Operators for \"maximum\" effectiveness"
