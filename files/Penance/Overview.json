    "Stoic Atonement applies Sanctuary and periodically deals Arts damage to surrounding enemies, in addition to strengthening the Barrier from Guardian of the Law",

  "cons": [
    "Very high DP cost â€“ the highest of all Operators at Elite 2",
    "Cannot be directly healed by friendly units (but can still be healed by indirect healing, e.g. Bard Supporters' trait) and have no ways to restore own HP, unlike other Juggernaut Defenders",
    "Very susceptible to Elemental Damage buildup",
    "Guardian of the Law can be less useful if Penance is deployed on low-traffic areas or other friendly units steal her kills too often",
    "Stoic Atonement stops Penance from attacking",
    "Trial of Thorns increases attack interval and has defensive SP recovery, rendering its SP unable to be charged outside combat and not suitable against high-speed unblockable enemies"
