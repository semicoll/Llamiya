  "name": "Saileach",
  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Low DP cost",
    "Support Î³ is one of the best DP generators in the game, especially at Mastery 3",
    "Unwavering Banner gives Saileach the namesake, which debuffs the ASPD of enemies and buffs the ASPD of friendlies around it; the banner can be planted on another location with Inheritance of Faith or Glorious Banner, and automatically returned to Saileach when the skill expires",
    "Inheritance of Faith plants the Unwavering Banner on a friendly with the lowest HP percentage, buffing their DEF and periodically healing them",
    "Glorious Banner plants the Unwavering Banner on an enemy, inflicting AoE damage and stun, and continuous Slow and Fragile to surrounding enemies",
    "Spiritual Influence reduces the DP cost of the next deployed unit when Saileach is deployed"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Can neither attack nor block enemies while the skill is active (though the latter can be an advantage since it makes melee enemies ignore Saileach)",
    "Spiritual Influence only works once each time Saileach is deployed"
