  "name": "Blemishine",
  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Highest ATK of all Guardian Defenders",
    "Has an attack range of 1 tile ahead, like that of most melee Operators",
    "Can heal friendlies with all three skills",
    "Deterring Radiance also put enemies into Sleep",
    "Knight of Sword and Shield allows Operators with defensive SP recovery to generate 1 SP in each attack",
    "Mercy allows Blemishine to attack Sleeping enemies, which prioritizes and deals more damage against them",
    "Divine Avatar inflicts an additional instance of Arts damage to the target and heals a friendly unit in each attack and has the highest healing output in the game"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Somewhat lower DEF than other Guardian Defenders",
    "Must be constantly fighting to function effectively â€“ Surging Brilliance is only activated when attacking while Deterring Radiance and Divine Avatar have defensive SP recovery, making them slow to charge outside of combat even with Knight of Sword and Shield",
    "Mercy is only useful in conjunction with Deterring Radiance or another source of Sleep",
    "Blemishine cannot heal herself with Divine Avatar"
