  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Very high HP",
    "Very high ATK compared to other Defenders",
    "Ward of the Fertile Soil grants one Shield and can hold multiple layers over a period of time, and restores Mudrock's HP each time a Shield is consumed",
    "Crag Splitter damages surrounding ground enemies with a chance of Stunning them, and restores Mudrock's HP",
    "Bloodline of Desecrated Earth renders Mudrock invulnerable (even from effects such as the Emperor's Blade's Collapsing Fear under a tile affected by Dominion) and slow enemies in the first phase as well as Stunning ground enemies upon expiring, and greatly improves her capabilities in the second phase",
    "Unshakeable Solidarity reduces damage taken from Sarkaz enemies"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Very high DP cost â€“ the highest of all Operators at Elite 2",
    "Cannot be directly healed by friendly units (but can still be healed by indirect healing, e.g. Bard Supporters' trait)",
    "Ward of the Fertile Soil's Shields can be easily wasted when facing multiple enemies and those with low attack interval, and against damage-over-time effects",
    "Crag Splitter has defensive SP recovery, making it slow to charge outside combat",
    "The first phase of Bloodline of Desecrated Earth stops Mudrock from attacking and blocking enemies (though the latter can be an advantage since it makes melee enemies ignore Mudrock)",
    "The Stun from Crag Splitter and Bloodline of Desecrated Earth only affects ground enemies and require precise timing to hit"
