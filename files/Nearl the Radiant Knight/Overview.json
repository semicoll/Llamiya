  "name": "Nearl the Radiant Knight",
  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Very high HP and ATK â€“ one of the highest of all Operators",
    "Night-scouring Gleam allows the Radiant Knight to act as an \"Executor\" Guard that doesn't occupy a deployment spot, especially when supported by Kazimierzian Operators",
    "Brave the Darkness deal Pure damage and stun adjacent enemies when the Radiant Knight is deployed, which is more effective if she is deployed after a Kazimierzian Operator",
    "Blazing Sun's Obeisance is one of the ultimate offensive skills, allowing the Radiant Knight to hold off literally every enemy when used correctly",
    "Daybreak makes the Radiant Knight's attacks ignore some of the target's DEF",
    "Can be obtained and used even if the player does not have Nearl in their roster"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Only available in the Celebration limited headhunting banners from Chop the Thorns, Open Circuit and Path of the Radiant; the Radiant Knight will not be available from any other headhunting banners",
    "Can only block one enemy",
    "The Radiant Knight will be automatically retreated when Night-scouring Gleam expire and have her redeployment time increased unless the previously deployed Operator is a Kazimierzian (which includes the Radiant Knight herself)",
    "Must be used in conjunction with Kazimierzian Operators, promoted and upgraded with modules for full effectiveness"
