  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Attacks deal Arts damage to all enemies in range",
    "Greatly increased DEF and RES when skill is inactive",
    "Foolproof Plan can nullify many sources of damage on its own or with support",
    "When Crystal Barrier is shattered, the stun and AOE damage can give an opportunity to recover",
    "Elegance is effective for stalling",
    "Shelter can provide stuns or defensive support for other Operators",
    "Riving Lighttails significantly improves Lin's damage, range, and defensive potential",
    "Shrouded Strength gives her great skill uptime when she can be consistently targeted by attacks"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Can only attack when skill is active",
    "DEF and RES buffs are disabled when skill is active (partially retained with module)",
    "Foolproof Plan's damage threshold is relatively low and thus relies on her DEF, RES and other sources of mitigation to remain active",
    "Crystal Barrier's long regeneration time leaves Lin vulnerable if it gets shattered",
    "Elegance does not provide any defensive boosts itself while active",
    "Riving Lighttails has poor uptime without help from her module-boosted 2nd talent"
