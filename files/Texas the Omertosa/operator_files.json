  "Archive_File_1": "An old friend of Rhodes Island.Many were shocked when Texas came to Rhodes Island with the two who would later become Vigil and Penance, as she looked unmistakably Siracusan.Those who knew her were uneasy about her return to Siracusa. Though it was well-known that she had something to do with the country, no one knew what lay in her past.Their minds were set at ease by the fact that she was joined by Penguin Logistics members. After all, Texas would be Texas as long as she was with Penguin Logistics.However, when it was learned what happened to her and Siracusa, and who she had brought to Rhodes Island, a consensus was quickly reached:Don't mess with Texas.",
  "Archive_File_2": "For Texas, Giovanna and Lappland each represented her past lives in Columbia and Siracusa.If not for what had happened 7 years ago, she might have become a reticent Lappland, or a cold-blooded Giovanna.Lappland symbolized hysteria toward Siracusa; she could not face it, but there was nowhere else to go to.Giovanna represented apprehension toward Columbia; she knew she did not have to do it, but she did not know what else to do.Texas knows that she would have walked the same paths as them, if she had not run away from it all.Whenever she came face-to-face with Lappland and Columbia, it filled her with nostalgia, but guilt as well.That is why she tolerated Lappland's actions, and accepted Giovanna's reproach. She was a Texas, no matter how much she detested everything to do with the family.She knew the price she paid when she chose to step away from it all.Was it worth it?She asked herself this many times, and unsurprisingly was never able to find the answer.After leaving Columbia and Siracusa, she desperately sought a new life to replace the old one.For her, life is not about searching for meaning; it was life itself that was worth searching for.Fortunately, she found what she was looking for.",
  "Archive_File_3": "Texas and Penguin Logistics did not stay in Nuova Volsinii for long.She returned to Lungmen with the other members soon after the events concluded. Penguin Logistics reopened, and there did not seem to be any changes in their lives.But she also meant her promise to Vigil: she would be there when Nuova Volsinii needs her.Nuova Volsinii was established with Signora Sicilia's blessing, and thus most of the families have chosen to sit on the sidelines, keeping an eye on developments. However, this is no more than the calm before the storm.Texas knows this, as do the rest of Penguin Logistics.At present, the main reason for them to travel between Lungmen and Nuova Volsinii is not so much Texas as Sora.The success of La Morte di Texas made Sora a star, prompting Monster Siren Records to change its strategy and encourage her to continue her activities in Siracusa. Nuova Volsinii presents an ideal platform for Sora in more ways than one.It was Sora, then, who has to regularly make the trip to Nuova Volsinii.Meanwhile, not wishing to let this opportunity go to waste, Croissant approached Bison and is trying to work with MountainDash Logistics and Vigil to build an international logistics route. It is a monumental task, but Croissant seems to enjoy it.Exusiai, for her part, has made it her mission to try every pizza parlor in Siracusa and find the best.For now, Texas is the one who is most idle.She knows, however, that there is something tying them together. They will always be together, whether going forwards or backwards.",
  "Archive_File_4": "Not much has changed with Texas. She has not taken up the surname Texas to create a new mafia family, nor does she intend to become part of Nuova Volsinii under Vigil. For her, the only change is that she has started to pay regular visits to Nuova Volsinii.She has made it clear that she will not stay in Siracusa when all is said and done. She does not want to leave too many traces there, and Vigil respects her decision. He has not interfered with Penguin Logistics's new Nuova Volsinii branch, and there are few among the mafiosi who know where the last Texas went after her brief reappearance in Volsinii.Of course, things are constantly changing.The waves that Bernardo stirred have calmed, but the families have begun to stir again. Siracusa's balance teeters on a precipice, leaving precious little time for Nuova Volsinii to grow peacefully.At the same time, the game that the Signori dei Lupi have played for many years has come to the surface. This round is coming to an end, and the impact it will have on Siracusa is yet unknown.The only thing that is certain is that change is coming to Siracusa.Should she claim power, or at least associate herself with it, in the name of the greater good? Texas knows that the answer should be \"yes,\" yet she has chosen to distance herself from Vigil and Penance.Her line of thinking is simple. She does not belong to that greater good; she is simply one of the common folk, who felt outraged out of the goodness of her heart. Her only promise to Vigil was that she would keep fighting, until either Siracusa has changed, or she is no more.",
  "Promotion_Record": "At the celebration of Texas's return, Emperor brought up the founding of Penguin Logistics.He was studying street performance in Columbia, when he smelled the presence of a Signore dei Lupi on Columbian soil, much to his surprise.He decided to look into it, and found Zaaro dealing with a humanâ€“Texas.\"Don't give me that look, Texas. Did you really think we met on that street by chance?\"He became interested in the mortal who was able to deal with a Signore dei Lupi, so he followed her, only to see her doubts and pent-up anger. For a long time, she lived like a walking corpse.\"I learned about what happened to the Texas family, so I thought I'd help you kids out a little. Ain't no time for brooding when your feet are busy, so I founded this joint, and dragged her into it.\"\"Huh...\"\"What's the matter?\"'Didn't think you had it in you to do something so decent, boss.\"\"Hey! I get no respect around here!\"\"So Columbia is the reason you like rap?\"'No, I'm the reason Columbia likes rap.\""
