  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Can deploy Soaring Dragons with good overall stats as force multiplier",
    "High-Efficiency Freezing Module is effective for stalling",
    "Laser Mining Module gives the Soaring Dragons an Arts damage attack, useful against enemies with high DEF",
    "Armed Combat Module gives the Soaring Dragons a ranged AoE attack, useful in most situations especially against groups of enemies",
    "All three skills recover the Soaring Dragons when they expires after activation, replenishing the Soaring Dragon's count",
    "Optical Refraction Accessories makes the Soaring Dragons invisible for a short time after deployed"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Rather low stats, even at maximum level",
    "The Soaring Dragons are counted towards the Unit Limit and only three of them can be deployed at a time (unlike other summons)",
    "The Soaring Dragons cannot block enemies, even when deployed on melee tiles (though this also makes melee enemies never attack them)",
    "Destroyed or retreated Soaring Dragons do not replenish their count, as with other summons",
    "Micromanagement-intensive, not recommended for casual or new players",
    "Must be leveled and promoted to Elite 2 for maximum effectiveness"
