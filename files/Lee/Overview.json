  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Has a redeployment cooldown of 25 seconds instead of other Operators' 70 seconds",
    "Very low DP cost",
    "Good stats",
    "Exorcise Evil marks an enemy to make friendlies attack them over the others, and unleash an explosion which deals heavy Arts damage to the surroundings; the explosion damage can be further increased (up to a limit) when Lee hits the victim while they are marked",
    "Kindness Begets Prosperity debuffs the ASPD of the enemy Lee is blocking while buffing his ASPD, with the buff doubled if there is only a single enemy in the surrounding tiles",
    "Honored Guest is a solid stalling and DPS-boosting skill, which also provides a good degree of survivability",
    "Preparedness Averts Peril negates the next Stun or Freeze instance received and temporarily Stuns the source"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Drains 3 DP every 3 seconds (2 DP every 3 seconds with the MER-X Module) when deployed; Lee will be automatically retreated if the player have less than 3 DP",
    "Does not return DP when retreated, unlike other Operators",
    "Exorcise Evil's detonation will occur prematurely if the damage build-up limit is reached or the victim is defeated, which can be detrimental",
    "Honored Guest's shift effect can be detrimental when used carelessly and Taunts enemies which can be detrimental if there are too many ranged enemies around Lee",
    "Preparedness Averts Peril drains 5 additional DP through Lee's trait to work, which can be detrimental on the early game",
    "Preparedness Averts Peril does not work against enemies with consecutive stunning attacks",
    "Very detrimental to use when the automatic DP generation is slowed or disabled"
