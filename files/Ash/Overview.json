  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Attack aerial enemies over ground ones",
    "Good stats",
    "Supporting Fire permanently improves DPS",
    "Assault Tactics increases her damage massively against stunnable enemies, and allows Ash to disorient and dispatch even the strongest of enemies",
    "Auxiliary Equipment Stuns groups of enemies in each deployment",
    "Breaching Rounds fires an M120 CREM that damages and pushes back enemies in its way, and detonates for more damage especially if it hits a melee tile adjacent to a ranged tile",
    "Breaching Specialist reduces DP cost and gives additional SP in the first deployment"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Can only be obtained during Operation Originium Dust from the Attack/Defence Tactical Collide headhunting banner; Ash can no longer be obtained in any way once the said crossover ends, unless further events involving Ubisoft and the Rainbow Six Siege franchises are launched and rerun",
    "Assault Tactics is mostly worthless on enemies that are immune to Stun",
    "Auxiliary Equipment's Stun only lasts for 20 out of 31 ammo for Assault Tactics, meaning other Stun sources are needed to maximize its damage",
    "Breaching Rounds can only be used twice per deployment and loses over 50% of its potential damage if it fails to hit a wall",
    "Breaching Specialist only works once per operation"
