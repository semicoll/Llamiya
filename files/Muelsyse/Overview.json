  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "The Flowing Shape can copy other operators' stats and be deployed on both melee and ranged tiles, making it very adaptable",
    "Melee Shapes steal ATK and DEF from enemies on attack, up to 250 extra ATK/DEF which bolsters its stats",
    "Ranged Shapes create a temporary copy every 10 attacks, increasing its damage output significantly",
    "Superficial Regulation provides amazing crowd control, either through melee Shapes pulling and stunning enemies, or through the ranged Shape instantly creating 4 clones and binding enemies on hit",
    "Has much better combat capabilities than most other Vanguards",
    "E2 talent reduces SP costs of all Rhine Lab operators including herself"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "High DP cost for a Vanguard (though her E2 talent somewhat makes up for that)",
    "Flowing Shapes only partially copy the operator's base stats (90% at E2), and do not copy their trait, talent(s) and skill",
    "Reliant on having good targets for her Flowing Shape to copy",
    "Doesn't fit quite as well in a traditional Vanguard role"
