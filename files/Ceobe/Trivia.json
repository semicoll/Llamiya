        "Ceobe's birthday, March 3rd (third day of the third month, or 3/3), and the fact that she has three skills with three different targeting priorities are also references to Cerberus.",
        "The  Delicious Honey Biscuit used in Ceobe's Fungimist is a reference to a practice of the ancient Greeks. Upon someone's death, they would put a piece of honey cake inside the coffin to please Cerberus."

      "text": "Interestingly, Ceobe's skills make her attack by using weapons identical to all three of Kratos' weapons in God of War: Ragnarök: Leviathan Axe (\"Really Cold Axe\"), Blades of Chaos (\"Really Hot Knives\"), and Draupnir Spear (\"Really Heavy Spear\"). Like Ceobe, Kratos is also based from Ancient Greek mythology."
