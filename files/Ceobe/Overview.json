  "pros": [
    "Attacks deal Arts damage",
    "Higher ATK than other Core Casters",
    "\"Really Hot Knives\" significantly improves DPS",
    "Thresher inflicts an additional instance of Arts damage based on the target's DEF in each attack, making it devastating against enemies with high DEF but low RES",
    "\"Really Heavy Spear\" greatly buffs ATK, extends range, and silences enemies hit by Ceobe's attacks",
    "Lone Journey slightly buffs ATK and ASPD when there are no friendlies adjacent to Ceobe"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Lower HP than other Core Casters",
    "All three skills modify Ceobe's targeting priority, which may be awkward at times",
    "Thresher is less effective against enemies with low DEF but high RES",
    "\"Really Heavy Spear\" causes Ceobe's attacks to deal Physical damage instead of Arts and target enemies with low DEF over the others, making Thresher not as effective especially on those with high RES"
