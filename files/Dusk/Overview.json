  "pros": [
    "Attacks deal AoE Arts damage",
    "Transcendental Stroke is good for delivering sustained AoE Arts DPS",
    "Flowing Ink buffs ATK, extends attack range, and makes attacks hit all enemies in range with enemies below 50% HP taking more damage",
    "Sublimity provides a stacking, slight ATK buff for each enemy defeated by Dusk (and Freelings later)",
    "Image Over Form vastly improves AoE crowd-control capabilities and summons/heals Freelings in each attack to help blocking and attacking enemies",
    "Finishing Touch summon a Freeling on the first attack made after deployment"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Only available from Festival limited headhunting banners from Hidden Moon; Dusk will not be available from any other headhunting banners",
    "Very high DP cost, tied with Ifrit and Mostima",
    "Image Over Form has a high SP cost",
    "The Freelings will only appear if the tile it were to be summoned is an open, deployable melee tile, and has a limited duration"
