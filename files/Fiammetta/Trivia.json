    {
      "text": "Her name is likely a combination fiamma/fiamme  and the suffix -etta in Italian. Together, the name means \"little flame\"."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fiammetta has the traits of a phoenix, with one manifested in fire being present in her Elite 2 artwork."
    },
    {
      "text": "Before her introduction as an Operator which revealed her name, the Arknights community often referred to her as either Suffering (one of her codenames in Code of Brawl) or Phoenix, which is taken from the name of her image file in the game files."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fiammetta's second Deployment voice line, \"What, you've got time to take in the sights?\", is a reply to Mostima's second Deployment voice line, \"Not a bad view.\" She is the only Operator whose voice line appears to be an explicit response to another Operator."
    },
    {
      "text": "Due to her perpetually fiery, tempestuous, and often confrontational attitude together with her red avian motifs, she is often compared with Red in the Angry Birds series."
    },
    {
      "text": "Her Communal Suffering trait has been a subject of memes in the community, where other Operators feel strange after being instantly invigorated due to her trait. Other depictions show her as a slave driver or an unwanted pep talker, with the revitalized Operator often feeling contempt afterwards."
