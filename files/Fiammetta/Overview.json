  "overview": "",
  "gameplay": "",
  "pros": [
    "Attacks deal splash damage",
    "High ATK",
    "Decent HP and DEF",
    "Sufferer of Tribulations gives an ATK Vigor when Fiammetta's HP is above 50%, which is doubled when she have 80% or more HP",
    "\"Paenitete\" can be a highly effective AoE skill when its usage is timed correctly",
    "\"Reponite\" is permanent and allow Fiammetta to deal massive splash DPS",
    "Herald of Revelations buffs ASPD outside skill activation",
    "Communal Suffering is a great way to get an Operator instantly back into their base roles without staying in the dorms"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "High DP cost that increases with every promotion",
    "Sufferer of Tribulations causes Fiammetta to lose HP over time (which fortunately is non-lethal), requiring constant heal in dangerous missions lest she becomes easy pickings for the enemy. If her HP goes down below 50% it also causes her Vigor buff to disappear unless she's healed back.",
    "All three skills have offensive SP recovery, making them slow to charge outside combat",
    "Fiammetta cannot attack normally with \"Reponite\", being forced to continuously attack the marked tile until deactivated"
