         "Sorting files? Whoa, I've suddenly gotten this headache. I can't take it, I need a break. Well, keep at it,Doctor. This little should be a walk in the park for you, right? A job? Of course I'm all ears, let's hear it... it's not detective work? Gray zone? Haha, we don't work like that. We're fine, upstanding citizens in my establishment, I run a legitimate business. HavingWaai FuandHungaround to keep an eye on thatAakboy really saves me a broken back. I'll admit, it's shameful, but I started out babysitting these kids, and now they're all taking care of me. Honestly, youngsters are always more grown up more than we think, though that's nothing to complain about. It's thanks to your patronage that the agency is still running smoothly, give or take.Lungmen's a place with the human touch–live there long enough, and sooner or later you'll know a crowd, find the right connections. We don't like spilling blood in our line of work–always best to solve things friendly. What do you think, Dr. {nickname}? Jaye makes a mean finball, doesn't he? Old Tung taught that boy his trade and his values. It all combines for a flavor unique to Lungmen. Come on, you try now. It'll warm you up. Under this heading, you had the third row on the left here wrong, so I patched that up, no need for thanks. Oh, do I come off very fluent? Not at all, this is still my first time accounting on a scale so small outside of the agency. Things used to be very–ah, I'm getting distracted, don't you mind. Why are the lights all on at this hour... oh? Ah, Dr. {nickname}, then. Are you still processing battle records? Well, I never thought you were such a workaholic. I'm impressed. But! You'd better turn in sooner. It's not worth it to break your body doing it. Everyone's chasing fame and profit, earning and losing, and just how many go out happily in the end? Just living a decent little life of your own's a lot to ask for. Ah, what are we all doom and gloom for? I'll go stir-fry something up, so you wait for me, Dr. {nickname}. How about a drink together? Myhexagramsays to avoid going out, so I'll pass on this mission today... what, I can't? I have to go, no two ways about it? Hah, I see. Then this is a special exception, once only! I'm lending you a hand, so dinner's on you tonight! Look, I'm all decided! This is the joint! Busying about can't beat a nice leisurely tea. *gulp* Dr. {nickname}, you keep some good leaves here. Hello, hello there, you must be Dr. {nickname}? You've been looking after my employees for me. They haven't made trouble for you, have they? Oh, that reminds me, here's a card formy agency. Take it, go ahead. How about a quick scrap? No, no, I'm just joking. I'm no good in a fight. A promotion...? There's a first for me. Feels quite fresh, too. I think times like these call for some magic words–thank you very much, boss? Life goes by in a flash. If you're always jostling for the lead, when do you stop to smell the roses? Don't think too hard about things. Enjoy the moment. No matter how paranoid you are, it'll happen if it's going to happen. And you've dealt with it, all's right with the world. Do I have to come along too? *Sigh*... fine, fine. Let's get going. Good. Follow my instructions closely, then. Alright, everyone, dismissed–wait, hold it, don't head off for real! I was joking! Joking! It's like we're on a school trip here, eh? When face to face, the \"hero\" prevails! Is not invariably true here at all. I'm sure you can sort them... wait, hold it. Am I up now? There, there. Put your worries to rest. I'm right here. Hello, friends, what are we talking about? Time for a little telling off. But not too harshly. Everybody: friendliness makes money. Okay, there, calm it down! You nearly spilled my tea! Everyone, I implore you to just reconsider–well, no room for argument, is there? *Grumble* I told you so. Don't get so worked up. My thanks. It couldn't have happened without you, Dr. {nickname}... I owe you for this one. I don't forget. A clean and tidy job, Dr. {nickname}. What, where was I just now? Well, I was moral support, of course. Cheered the whole time. Now, now, hold it! Do not press an enemy at bay. Let them run free. Risky, risky. There's a terrifying fortune to get.

         "As I am now, will my presence inconvenience you? Will I remind you of the unbearable past? I... want you to allow me to remain at your side. When the time comes, we will leave this place together, okay? You used to think that we could not survive if we completely left the sea? That's not the case.My kinand I will soon be able to swim through the air. In the end, even those places devoid of anything can become our ocean. We simply need to evolve, to continuously adapt. My former colleagueswished to slay me. They refused to face themselves, but I will not resent them. I could not hurt them, even if they rejected me so vehemently... attacked me. Everything I did was bringing them harm, no? My regrets died along with them. This box? This box contains my past... The fragments in it are all my past. Even these fragments can prove that I am not an empty shell... that I am not a ghost. Gradually, bit by bit, I have turned into what I am now. Did the past you ever foresee a future like this,Dr. {nickname}? Even if the current you can only hate me. I do not fear your hatred, Doctor. If you desire, continue to hate me... while you are still able to hate. Your companions,Kal'tsitandAmiya, said that I could trust you in the end, but nobody can save others. I failed to save my colleagues, andyou failed to save them. We have both lost everything, but I regained my life and my future. This is unfair to you. In the past, before I leftÆgir, my family was murdered. I always assumed it was the handiwork ofthe sea monsters, but... I never expected that it was all the doing of the Ægir. My blood kin and my songs are not scary at all. It is people who are scary. I once struggled, I once resisted. What good did it serve? The traces of weak lifeforms will eventually be drowned by the tide. You are my very last friend. Will you also be like them, meaninglessly rejecting the ocean even if it costs you everything? Do you wish to become the old me? Am I sick? Or am I still dreaming? I dreamt that the black sky was our ocean. When the others and I swam up, we did not feel ourselves sinking at all. Strange, so strange. Is this our future? Their faces are so blurry, they... They... No, no. Dream... What kind of dream will you have? Where are you now? There... Is this also a dream? I am waiting for you, Dr. {nickname}. I've waited for you for too long, far too long, to the point that I have already forgotten why I am waiting for you here... But none of this is important anymore. It's not that important anymore. These things... I have seen them too many times. Nobody needs things like these anymore. Are the restrictions of the past still necessary? Nothing is left except for you and me. If you are willing to come closer to me, we can cast those things aside... Become my blood kin, Dr. {nickname}. My sword has eroded, my former colleagues are no longer here, the liquid flowing through my body is no longer blood, but I am satisfied. I have become one with the ocean. Come with me – your true form is still waiting for you beneath the wave's depths. Fight alongside the others? Who will we fight? No more lives should be lost. What will it feel like... when they harm me with their weapons? Don't treat me as a calamity. I do not wish death upon anyone. What do you wish to do? I shall obey. No longer do I walk alone. My blood kin are walking with me. Now then, please listen to the song of the distant sea... Don't worry. Everything will be fine. The air and the land... are all too dry. My song shall seep into your souls. Follow me, follow me back to our eternal hometown. Do not fear, my comrades... I will be there soon. They will become our blood kin. They no longer need to feel the suffering of aridity. Their prior existence was already too painful. Is this how you will treat me? Is this the ending you also wish for me to have? If that is your desire, I can accept it. Why must you flee? This futile struggle will only bring about more senseless terror. Run away, Doctor... Run away, from here, from me... Run away. Sooner or later, this place too will return to its primordial form. ...Why am I still wearing this hat? We cannot protect anything. We can only hope for a harmonious future. Doctor... Come to me. Arknights."

Do you need my skills? Time to start working! The equipment is working fine![note 1] Is the target marked? Ok, the drone is launched! Now! Snow blindness is a terrible think[sic], you know! 3......2......1! \"Bloom, my flowers!\" Watch out, that's a blind spot! Huh, it's already over? As expected, Doctor, you're so reliable. There are no other hostile signals. There are still enemies nearby. Will you pursue them? We've been surrounded? Its my fault... Huh? Th-there are even heated floors?! Ahh~ this is bliss~ Huh? Lets go, Lets go! Ice skating is not that scary with me here. Do you need something? Arknights."

         "Greetings,Doctor... Is there anything you'd like to discuss? You look quite pale. You say your... chest hurts? Don't overwork yourself, please get some rest immediately. Don't be afraid, I'm right beside you. Everything is okay... You've seen my healingArtssomewhere before? You must be imagining things. That's almost certainly the case... TheConfessor...? How do you know his name? Sorry, this is a topic I don't wish to discuss... WeSarkazcombined our inherent Arts affinity with the power ofOriginiumto develop new healing Arts, which we've been using for quite some time to tend to refugees. Now? We have nothing left now. The war bereaved us of all hope. My relation withNearl? Certainly... She's a travel companion, and someone I trust with my own life. In order to bring salvation to those in pain, one must be ready to make the ultimate sacrifice. That's the kind of person Nearl is. Once upon a time, I dedicated my life to following someone who shone so brightly in my eyes. A conspiracy took that person away from me, but this time... I'll make sure my light source continues to shine on forevermore. Even if I die... ...This silence reminds me of those days in my hometown. I am Shining, roamingmedic. You say you've seen me before? Perhaps we've passed by each other during our journeys. Power that merely heals wounds... is not enough. I can't save everyone just by being a medic. That's right. I cannot be just a medic... I will live on as adefender. That's always been my goal. Doctor, please be a witness to this oath of mine. Are we heading into battle? This is a battle for our own sakes, right? War is inevitable. I hope this war will lead to salvation... Let's begin. Yes, I'm listening. Our choice is between prosperity or destruction. You won't suffer long. I will protect you. Don't be afraid. I'm sad that I must do this... I've never forgotten the pain. The stronger the enemy, the more motivated we are, and the higher our morale. No matter how many sins one commits, they all turn to ashes when their life ends. Even if we return someday, there is no salvation for anyone here. Victory and loss... these are mere insignificant moments in the endless cycle. I don't mind as long as I have a quiet place to be alone. What is it? It's been a while since I've been this calm. I can even hear your heartbeat. How are you feeling today, Doctor? Arknights."

Do not get caught up within it. The world I paint is much more fascinating than this one. How many have been lost, since ancient times, how many have escaped? Don't keep me too long. Captain? What does a captain do? Let's get this over with. I'm in a good mood today. I'll give you my \"Bones on the Sand\" then. Don't go too far. Better leave the fine brush at home. Would any of you like to be my paint? This battlefield would do well with a splash of ink. Too difficult to explain, let me paint it for you. With the setting of the sun, the brush draws up the peaks! Copy the infinite with the tangible, bring the intangible to life! I am rather attached to you. Most of the time. Once, painting and war were quite different. But with this power, battle is art. Not bad. Hm... a failed painting must be destroyed. It will bring shame. Slipped on a stroke? Start over. Do not bother preparing the room for me. I will handle it myself. You'll spill my ink! Hey, don't get paint everywhere. What was your name again? Oh, {nickname}? Arknights."

         "It's a good thing to be alert,Doctor. Well, please continue with your work. Rest assured, I'm here to protect you. I've met plenty of people who claim to practice martial arts, but they are all just weaklings putting up a front. Not that girl,Waai Fu, however. She's an interesting one... and although she still has a ways to go, I look forward to fighting her once she grows up. Rhodes Islanddoesn't have a cellar, you say? Now that won't do. Alcohol is indispensable. Not only is it something that can be savored and enjoyed, you can also drown your sorrows with it. So there you have it, Doctor. Get a cellar built. I dare say I know a thing or two about alcohol, should you need my assistance. I built a library back inMansfield, but most of the books I could get my hands on there wereColumbian. It gets boring after a while. The collection there simply doesn't hold a candle to what Rhodes Island has. The library here has a sizable collection of literature from other countries. It's marvelous. When you find yourself in the face of oppression, it is futile to even try to come up with countermeasures... I used to believe that, but I later realized that there's no power out there that's absolute. At the very least, I don't have that kind of power, and that's why I'll never look down on anything again, no matter how insignificant. I used to think that Rhodes Island was just another Mansfield, a prison of \"freedom.\" And you. You are me. You are a prisoner of freedom. You are the king. Yet now I know that's not the case. This is not a prison, and you are the friend of everyone here. Are the ones over there fromRhine Lab? Don't worry. I don't really have a grudge about Rhine Lab itself, and they are my colleagues now. I wouldn't do anything that gives you a headache. It's just I may have something to ask them one of these days. Doctor, do you have some time later? Let me take you out for a drink... Oh, it's nothing important. I merely have a few secrets that I'd really like to get off my chest. I haven't made a new friend for a long time, after all. You are a very good friend, Doctor. When I have everything sorted out, should I still be alive, do pay Mansfield a visit. That is my kingdom, and I am willing to share all that I have there with you. For you to fall asleep so defenselessly in the company of others... I can't tell if you are being trusting or negligent. I owe Rhodes Island my life, so allow me to be completely honest, Doctor. I am going after a certain department within Rhine Lab. If you don't want your relationship with them ruined, now is the time to turn me away. Battlefield experience, huh? Indeed, that's something that I don't have. Thank you, Doctor. Doctor, don't be afraid. I don't fight anyone undeserving of my rage. Doctor, take a good look. That mask of composure, calm, and politeness is off. This is the truest you'll ever find me. Bloodthirsty, violent, and destructive. Look at me and be my friend. Perfect. It's just about time to get a little exercise in. I'm the leader, so follow my lead. Let's go. Never underestimate the enemy. I'm right here. Where would you like me? I'll hold myself back. I won't let them go much further. Face me! Haven't had breakfast? Come with all you've got! Bring it on, you scoundrels! Warm-up's over! A precarious situation is the perfect opportunity to better ourselves, but we must also know our own limits. Doctor, there is no need to put ourselves in the spotlight when the time's not right. Unnecessary violence is just a way to blow off steam. I got myself under control a long time ago. As long as we're still alive, that's hardly a defeat. The ceiling here is a little low, isn't it? Huh? Doctor, why don't we discuss these books? Stay alert, Doctor. Arknights."

Well, you're an expert onCatastrophestudies, so you're like a professor, right? Aren't we all supposed to address our superiors with respect? Pardon me? Please say that again? Oh, you're wondering why I'm hard of hearing? Well, I got infected with Oripathy back when I was doing research near a volcano... Besides completing the tasks you give me, I have to go to Dr.Kal'tsitregularly for checkups. The doctor said my symptoms are pretty serious... I have to work hard to finish the research my parents began! I want to prove that their work was meaningful, and that it could maybe even change the world! My parents... they've passed on. A pyroclastic flow hit them when they were conducting studies near a volcano... I have to pick up where they left off and finish their research, no matter what! My playmates? I'm pretty friendly withMousseand some others, so I don't feel lonely at all! If possible, I'd love to start a book club with them too. Could we hold our club meetings in your office, Professor? Dr. Kal'tsit told me... I'm losing not only my sense of hearing, but my sense of sight too. …Well, what else might this disease do to me? How could I tell you were behind me? Because I could feel your warmth! My eyesight and hearing aren't as sharp as they once were, but my other senses are still the same. Can't bring me down this easily, you know! Professor! Oh... You're asleep...? I'm Eyjafjalla. My career before joiningRhodes Islandwas in the field of volcanology. I'm a bit hard of hearing due to my Oripathy. I just hope I won't be a burden to you, Professor. Please teach me all you can, Professor. Promotion? Really? I'm so happy to have your approval, Professor! My mother gave me these little lambs. They're cute, aren't they? Huh? They're scorching hot? Be careful! You have to put on oven mittens before touching them! Understood, Professor. Don't forget to prepare emergency supplies as well as weapons! We can take care of ourselves, Professor. You just focus on giving orders. Stay safe, everyone. Professor? Please give your orders, Professor. I'll be careful. All the best! Temperature is stable! This may be a little hot... Watch out for fires. How's that? I'm so glad you're safe, Professor...

I'm here to save people, after all, not beat 'em up. Gotta work that out. Doctor, check it. Getting an extra weapon's kind a juggling act, so I found a solution. Trained my tail a little, and now, I can use it to hold my staff. Only downside is–I think my tail got thicker after all that exercise. How's that, Doctor? Shoulders feel much better, right? I told you, controlling my strength's a piece of cake, it's just none of you wanna believe me. I've been practicing medicine for years now. It's about time you recognized it, don't you think? Oh, yeah, Doctor, it's been a while sinceyour last trip toAcahualla, right? You can go back with me, if you're free next time I go to check it out. I'm telling you, it's a party there now. Even I'm wondering what my home's gonna be like when I visit again. Doctor, you know there's times you can trust your intuition. You've got all theseOperatorswho trust you, see. Even with your eyes closed, your fists are still real strong–What? Compared to mine? Hmmm... I could suplex you before you even made it out of this office, so I think I'm the stronger one there, haha! Zumamacan build machines,Tomimican manage people,Inamlooks like she makes a damned good lord ameer... Man, my friends rule! Heh, still, I've got my superior medical skills. Huh? What do you mean that's the one thing they'd argue? Y'know, Doctor, I never understood why you made everything so complicated all the time. Now, in a small sorta way, I get it. To put it in plaintalk, you're just finding ways to make your own fists stronger. So let me get real here, Doc. It's time you worked out with me. Zumama was right. All I gotta do is think about how to get stronger, how to get my fists out. So I've got an extremely serious question to ask you, Doctor... If I get Zumama to build us a two-seaterRaging Ironhide, do you wanna ride driver-side or passenger? Alright, gotta wake up the Doc in a minute. What's the play here...? Hold on, Doctor, I know what you wanna ask, and my files are still up in Medical. But, y'know, Dr. Kal'tsit's got a point. Doesn't reflect well on Medical to have a physician steamrolling around the front lines, so from now on, this is how I'm heading out. Yeah, pause it there. Wouldn't a quick axe chop do the job? *sigh* Just doesn't give me the same kick I get being endorsed for my medical skills... Doctor, doesn't matter if I have my axe or my staff, I'm just hoping to accomplish a little something, make everyone else's lives that little bit happier. I've managed to do a bunch so far, and before my body gives out on me here, I've got plans to do a whole lot more. Leave the front to me. The rear's all yours! You get to follow me, under one condition–you all stay alive and well. Got it? Heading out! Oh, yeah, speaking of which, I forgot to ask. What was our objective again? Alright, guys! Let's bring the noise! Doctor, leave the big guys to me! I'll cover any holes in the front! Chill out, you've got me now! The rest is up to you guys! Relax, it'll be over in an instant. Face me! Who's next?! Hell yeah! Uh... might be kind of weird to say at this point, Doctor, but completing a mission this hard on nothing but trust for others–that's pretty damn neat. Everybody good? Heh, we've got the next fight still waiting for us. Pump yourselves up! We're gonna crush this mission together! Don't panic. Doesn't matter if we're chasing 'em down watching for a counterattack, just leave it to me. I want anyone who needs it resting up! Doctor, hold on tight to my shoulders. Okay? Don't go blaming me if you fall off. I guess I'll drop in at Medical before the mission. What's the rush, Doc? Not like I'm gonna run away. You look pretty free to me, Doctor. Just so happens I am too. Wanna take a walk? Doctor! ...Oops, my bad. Didn't bruise you, did I? Arknights."

Our meals used to be pretty nice in the past... but the quality's gone downhill since we joinedIndra's group. I had a dream... a dream where the sun rises, and in the distance beyond the horizon... there wasmy hometown. The place I'll probably never get to return to ever again. Before I knew it, I'd gotten accustomed to this drifter's life... It's a strange thing. In the past I never imagined this was how I'd end up. Gawainand company? I wouldn't say they ran into me, more like they picked me up off the streets. I used to stand side by side with Indra's team when we fought in the streets ofVictoria... Looking back, I suppose it's a fairly fond memory to me. Stay on your guard! I know you've done the best you can, but there may be unknown dangers beyond our abilities. If we're ever put in a tough situation... then I may well act on my own motives. And if it comes to that, Doctor, I hope you'll join me too in... no, never mind for now. Oh, you fell asleep... I wonder if you ever dream of your hometown, too. I've passed the strength test, right? So assign me some missions. Don't let this hammer get too bored. My codename? They call me the Siege. Curious name, but it's got a nice ring to it. Feels pretty good. A promotion? Interesting... Another promotion? All right, thanks... Life is strange like that, you know? Once upon a time, I was the one assigning new ranks to people. Tell me, is this battle inevitable? You'd better get used to my combat style. For want of a nail... the kingdom was lost.

Very well. \"The fool flaunting his gallantry reaches none with his vanity...\" \"Fool, for what reason hast thou come?\" \"Art thou mine worthy enemy, or art thou naught but a jester?\" \"Thy pleas falleth upon deaf ears.\" The fiercer the battle, the more jubilant victory shall be. A satisfying battle. It even brought palpitations to my heart. We should strive for better. Retreat at once, while there still is time. For a place to rest my feet, it is acceptable. Hmm? Let me rest for just a while. I'm more tired than I thought. My apologies. You haven't changed one bit, my friend. Arknights."

AsAbyssal Hunters, we must fulfill our responsibilities. To abandon the sacrifices of the past would be an unforgivable act of betrayal. That being said, how many Hunters can I still save other thanSpecterandSkadi? Even if I save another Hunter who survived, the fear may have crushed them whole long ago. It would only be dragging out their agony. Do you like to sing? What about dancing? How about a dance with me, then? It doesn't matter if you don't know the steps. I will teach you. Songs, art, music... You must never forget these things. These expressions are proof that all those who stand beneath that sky full of stars once lived. That's how they take form and live on. Come, let's dance. Kal'tsit implored me to seek your help, but I don't completely trust you yet. Your technology is primitive compared toÆgir, and your mental state is even more problematic... Many of you are fearful and cowardly. I cannot begin to imagine you people taking on\"that.\" The air here is dry. Fighting on land sometimes leaves me feeling dry. This is better than being surrounded by the dead bodies of my comrades, however... when the sea was filled to the brim with shreds of their bodies. Their deaths get etched onto your brain, and the stench of their rotting bodies will fill your mouth each and every time you open it. Even so, we must never hang our heads. We are not of the same race. Do you think we can form an alliance in spite of that? Kal'tsit is far older than me, and I cannot begin to imagine the burden she carries, but they are all things that you must face one day... You need to get stronger. You need to not fear loss. I will watch you by your side. Hmph... Dr. {nickname}. I am Gladiia, the officer in charge ofRhodes Island'sÆgir affairs. We will have many opportunities to collaborate in the future, but please see me as an outsider. I am not worthy of your trust yet. I see. Your tactics and equipment match your kind's development progress. A new contract? I appreciate your recognition, but I already have many important missions assigned to me. It will be a while until I get to these new missions from you. I apologize for the inconvenience. War. The concept of victory doesn't exist in a war that revolves around the continuance of a race. The only conclusion it can lead to is the destruction of all other races under the night sky. We Abyssal Hunters put our lives on the line to fend off and delay this fate. Always, unrelenting, and without any regrets. As your squadron's aide, I will participate in your trainings. It seems this won't be a difficult battle. Allow me to use this as an opportunity to train your operators' hunting abilities. You are as slow as though you are bogged down in mud, but don't let it get to you. I will slow down and wait. Considering the level of this battle, allow me to save my strength. Please, go ahead. As you wish. Who's the prey? I'll take care of it right away. Be careful. The currents here will swallow the weak whole. Have you asked for my permission before you tried to run away from me, my dear prey? It won't take even half a second. This lance will pierce your heart. That's enough playtime with toys. Live. That's the only rule you must follow. An archetypical victory. One day, you will be able to defeat all feeble creatures that come your way. If the preys that got away have no means to share information, then you still have a chance to live. How mediocre. I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm perhaps more comfortable staying in my own little cramped dwelling. Please, respect the land's etiquette, Doctor, or perhaps discourtesy is more your thing? Best be careful. My kind are all monsters in nature. Hello, Dr. {nickname}. Arknights."

There may be plenty of capable archers amongst my sisters, but I don't boast when I proclaim that I'm the only one able to adapt multiple combat modes at once! Heheh! At least, out of my year I am! It was only once I left the Monastery that I realized my arrows may do more than defend the Apostle. It can aid so manyInfected, beset by injustice... I'm very proud, but occasionally I'll remember the days gone past where I simply drew my bow, and loosed. Now, every arrow has become so much more weighty. So as to rebuild the Monastery, my sisters have left to seek cooperation across all of Terra. *sigh*! Landen Monastery, age-old guard of Laterano, is now a dispatch agency... If only those old men would grant a little more funding. What kind of an excuse is \"teach with gift, not with gifts!?\" Rhodes Island is a world apart from Laterano. All with a different scape in their hearts, mingling together. It truly is an extraordinary thing. Doctor, you must consider coming to the Monastery to teach after you retire. Issues of faith? That'll be no problem! None of us will mind. At the start of spring, we'll prune the overgrown vines, and then open up the cellar come evening and retrieve the wine. The moment the setting sun catches through our glasses, we'll down them in one gulp. Ceremony? No, it's just a custom of ours. Life and faith became one long ago, and we don't want to lose it, that's all. I feel like I heard bells... mm, just my imagination. Cleric of Landen Monastery, Operator Archetto. Today on, I'll be in formal cooperation with you, for the rebuilding of the Landen Monastery famed far and wide! Doctor, if you would, please look over these contract terms! I see, I see, so this is how Rhodes Island's operators fight! Truly, they're exemplary! A promotion? My greatest thanks. Hm? I seem at peace? Of course. When you spend five years partaking in commendation ceremonies for outstanding clerics where everyone sleeps the whole way through from hangover, these things don't get to you much. Another promotion? Hmm... all the companies outside seem to strongly emphasize a hierarchical structure. Well, seeing as my promotion's been set in stone, does that mean Rhodes Island is willing to agree and sign to long-term cooperative terms with our Monastery? May Rhodes Island see for itself the distinguished tactical accomplishments of Landen Monastery. Cooperating with my Sisters, everyone always drowned each other out... but under my command, things may be a little terser. I'll do my utmost. Arrow nocked. Enemy sighted. Your orders. What arrow should I use? I've found our prey. May the Lord bless us. Draw. Take aim. Loose. Feel the bowstring's shake... Gospel, gather at my fingertips... My bow has three choices, and the enemy three hardships. \"Long may the Monastery's bells sound.\" This is a prayer for victory. Though we've already won! Right! I joined in this battle. Now nobody will think Landen Monastery's just an ornament of Laterano, will they? ...Please allow me the chance to remedy this! This is my mistake, and in no way represents the Monastery! Were battles beyond the walls... always so cruel? It's too stifling in here. There's near to none of the Monastery's sunshine! Oh — is something wrong? Ah, Doctor, I've been thinking whether I should invite you with me to come see Laterano. Perhaps you'd have more interest in the Monastery then... May the Lord bless you, Doctor. Arknights."

But for Ifrit's sake, I do need your help to correct all those twisted laws and rules. I am within my rights to oversee and bring up my own opinion on your command. Send me the operation briefing, I will review it. AllOperatorsmust maintain strict disciplines. Are they the ones who caused such destruction and started all this conflict? It's my turn. Suppress them. Forward. Vermin. Just who are you weaklings going to stop like that? This will be over soon. Solidify. Yielding is not an option. Your tactics appear modern, yet the ideas behind them are primitive at their roots. Just who are you? All must return to the existing order. None shall disobey the rules. The routed enemies may be calling for reinforcement. We must not drop our guard before we find the last of them. Where did I go wrong...? This room has interesting decor. I'd be more fond of a futuristic style, though. Hm? What? Doctor, you might do a bit of research into the past in your free time. You will find many a thing of great interest. Doctor, are you well?
